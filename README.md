# base-converter

## CS1800 Final Project

For my CS1800 class at Northeastern, I chose to make my final project a base converter in Python3.
The program has an interactive menu where the user can select numbers to convert between bases (2-36)
or 2's complement (to or from base 10).

1.	Download Python 3 and check off “Add to PATH” if on Windows (tested working on Windows 64-bit Python 3.9.4, available to download from https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.	Unzip the files to a directory such as Downloads and confirm you can see the project.py file.
3.	Launching the software depends on your operating system:
  * Windows
    *	Open a Command Prompt by hitting WIN+R, typing “cmd”, then ENTER.
  *	Mac:
    *	Open a Terminal window by hitting Cmd + Space, typing “terminal”, then ENTER.
4.	Navigate to the directory with the project.py file from the earlier step by typing ```cd <directoryname>``` (e.g., “cd Downloads”). Use the TAB key to autocomplete names of directories as you type.
5.	Type ```python3 project.py``` and hit ENTER to launch the program. If it does not work, try “python project.py” as occasionally Python is added to PATH without traditional naming convention.

I opted to use pytest for running checks on the code as I revised to use a more efficient solution, and manually reviewed the printed outputs made sense.
